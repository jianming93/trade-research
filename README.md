## Overview
Personal understanding of how trading works and creating a mini framework to allow research for trading strategies

## Simple breakdown
### Strategy
A strategy in general has 2 main objectives that is when to long and when to short. As such the factory/prototype approach to design this will include rules to long and rules to short.

### Portfolio
A portfolio can be considered the following from personal definition:

1) A group of symbols a strategy should act on
2) A group of strategies that act on one or more symbols

In short, a portfolio will consist of a family of strategies.

### Universe
A universe is considered to be all the possible symbols that exist. This does not necessarily mean all symbols offered by the exchange as it can be a sampled universe.
